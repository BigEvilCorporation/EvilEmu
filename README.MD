# Getting started

- Grab ion::engine from https://github.com/BigEvilCorporation/ion-engine
- Run ion_symlink.bat AS ADMINISTRATOR to link up the engine
- Run megaEx/GenerateWorkspace_VS20XX.bat to create and open a Visual Studio workspace
- You'll also need OpenAL redist until I've finished porting ion::audio
